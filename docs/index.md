**A Python semver parsing library.**

## Project Description

Madonna is a small, simple [semver] utility library with support for parsing, writing, and otherwise interacting with semantic versions in code.

**Why the stupid name?**

Get it? "Like a Version"... üëèüèª

Also naming things on PyPI is hard so

‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the successful artist, this madonna is in early development

## Installation

```shell
pip install madonna
```

## Quickstart

The only construct in madonna is the `Version` object, you can use it for all sorts of useful things...

### Create a New Version

```python
from madonna import Version

v = Version(major=1, minor=2, patch=4)
```

### Parse a Version from a string

```python
from madonna import Version

Version.from_string("v1.2.4-rc.1+build.123")
# Version(major=1, minor=2, patch=4, prerelease="rc.1", buildmetadata="build.123")
```

### Or JSON

```python
from madonna import Version

Version.from_json('{"major": 1, "minor": 2, "patch": 4}')
```

And you can also dump a `Version` to a variety of formats too!

## Contributing
